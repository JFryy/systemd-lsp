**Type**

Configures the process start-up type for this service unit. One of:
- **simple** (default): systemd considers the service to be started up immediately
- **exec**: like simple, but systemd will wait for exec() in the main service process
- **forking**: the service calls fork() and the parent exits
- **oneshot**: similar to simple, but the process must exit before systemd starts follow-up units
- **dbus**: the service is considered ready when the specified BusName appears on DBus
- **notify**: the service will issue a notification when it has finished starting up
- **idle**: similar to simple, but actual execution is delayed until all active jobs are dispatched
